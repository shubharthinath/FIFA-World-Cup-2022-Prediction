# FIFA-World-Cup-2022-Prediction
Predicting Winner of the FIFA World Cup 2022 using Python and Data Science

Here I gathered data by web-scaping it from Wikipedia and official FIFA databases, using python and BeautifulSoup and stored them in CSV files.

Used the data systematically to predict group-wise points distribution and winners of each match using Poisson Distribution.

P(X=k) = λk * e– λ / k!

Then predicted winners of knockout stage matches - Round of 16, Quarter Finals, Semi Finals and the Final.
